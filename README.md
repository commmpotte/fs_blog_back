# Full-Stack Blog Application - Backend

Welcome to the backend repository for the Full-Stack Blog Application. This repository contains the server-side code for handling user authentication, managing articles, and serving data to the frontend. My frontend part is here: https://github.com/commmpotte/fs_blog_front

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The server is built using Node.js, providing a robust runtime environment.

- **Express.js**: Express is used as the web application framework to handle routing and middleware.

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB serves as the database to store blog articles and user information.

- **Authentication**: User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure routes.

## Installation

To run the backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Configure the environment variables as needed (e.g., database connection URL, JWT secret).
5. Start the server using `npm start`.

## API Routes

- `/api/auth`: Handles user authentication and registration.
- `/api/posts`: Manages blog articles, including creation, editing, and deletion.
- Customize routes and functionality as per your application requirements.

## Deployment

This backend is deployed on a platform like Heroku to serve data to the frontend.

Thank you for using the Full-Stack Blog Application - Backend!
